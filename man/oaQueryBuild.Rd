oaQueryBuild(
  identifier = NULL,
  entity = "works",
  filter = NULL,
  date_from = NULL,
  date_to = NULL,
  search = NULL,
  sort = NULL,
  endpoint = "https://api.openalex.org/"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{identifier}{is a character. It indicates an item identifier.}

\item{entity}{is a character. It indicates the scholarly entity of the search. The argument can be equal to
entity = c("works", "authors", "venues", "institutions", "concepts"). The default value is entity = works".}

\item{filter}{is a character. Filters narrow the list down to just entities that meet a particular condition--specifically, a particular value for a particular attribute.
Filters are formatted thusly: attribute:value. The complete list of filter attributes for each entity can be found
at \href{https://docs.openalex.org/api/get-lists-of-entities#filter}{https://docs.openalex.org/api/get-lists-of-entities#filter}}

\item{date_from}{is a character. It indicates the starting date of the time-span. The format is YYYY-MM-DD. The default values is \code{date_from=NULL}.}

\item{date_to}{is a character. It indicates the ending date of the time-span. The format is YYYY-MM-DD. The default values is \code{date_from=NULL}.}

\item{search}{is a character. Search is just another kind of filter, one that all five endpoints support. But unlike the other filters, search doesn't require an exact match.
To filter using search, append .search to the end of the property you're filtering for.}

\item{sort}{is character. Use the sort parameter to specify the property you want your list sorted by.
You can sort by these properties, where they exist:display_name, cited_by_count, works_count, publication_date, relevance_score.}

\item{endpoint}{is character. It indicates the url of the OpenAlex Endpoint API server. The default value is endpoint = "https://api.openalex.org/"}
}
\value{
a character containing the query in OpenAlex format.

### FIRST EXAMPLE
# Query to search all works citing the article:
#  Aria, M., & Cuccurullo, C. (2017). bibliometrix:
#   An R-tool for comprehensive science mapping analysis.
#   Journal of informetrics, 11(4), 959-975.

#  published in 2021.
#  The paper is associated to the OpenAlex id W2755950973.

#  Results have to be sorted by relevance score in a descending order.

query <- oaQueryBuild(
identifier=NULL,
entity = "works",
filter = "cites:W2755950973",
date_from = "2021-01-01",
date_to = "2021-12-31",
search=NULL,
sort="relevance_score:desc",
endpoint = "https://api.openalex.org/")


### SECOND EXAMPLE
# Query to search all works containing the exact string
# "bibliometric analysis" OR "science mapping" in the title, published in 2020 or 2021.

# Results have to be sorted by relevance score in a descending order.

query <- oaQueryBuild(
   identifier=NULL,
   entity = "works",
   filter = 'title.search:"bibliometric analysis"|"science mapping"',
   date_from = "2020-01-01",
   date_to = "2021-12-31",
   search=NULL,
   sort="relevance_score:desc",
   endpoint = "https://api.openalex.org/")
}
